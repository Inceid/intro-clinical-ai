Use your favorite LLM for this. 

## Instructions 
1. Get into groups of 3-4. 
2. At least one person should be a "prompter".
3. Choose/create a vignette.
4. Apply the RTF framework to create a management plan. 
5. After discussing the plan with your group, follow up with an optimization to your initial prompt. Did the model miss something you want to correct? Any specific context?

## Vignettes 
Choose one of these vignettes, or a patient encounter you've had recently. I prefer that you provide the vignette!

1. A 42-year-old man presents to the hospital with three weeks of progressive personality changes, difficulty concentrating at work, and intermittent headaches. His partner reports increasing forgetfulness and irritability. He denies fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, or recent illness. He has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. He recently returned from a business trip to the Midwest United States, where he spent time hiking and gardening. On examination, he is afebrile, alert, and oriented but has mild short-term memory deficits and subtle right-sided weakness. There are no focal cranial nerve findings, and his neck is supple.

2. A 29-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic with three weeks of worsening pain and swelling in her hands, wrists, and knees. She reports morning stiffness lasting over an hour and increasing fatigue. She denies recent travel, tick bites, or trauma. She has a family history of autoimmune disease (mother with Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis). She also notes intermittent low-grade fevers and occasional mouth sores. On review of systems, she reports mild hair thinning but denies rashes, photosensitivity, or weight loss.

Title: Catching up to speed on Clinical AI: Prompting, Scribes, Risk Prediction, Agents, Frameworks

**Reflections:**
- Reflect on a recent clinical experience where you saw or used a clinical AI tool in practice. How did its use affect your decision-making or patient interaction? 
- What aspects of AI do you wish you learned about more in your curriculum?
- What concerns or opportunities do you foresee with the increasing integration of AI in healthcare?
- (Optional) Have you witnessed an AI [hallucination](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/hallucinations-in-ai-generated-medical-summaries-remain-a-grave-concern/) while using it in a clinical scenario? How did you address it?

**Objectives:** The objectives of this workshop are to:
- **Define** the various use cases of AI in healthcare and current implementation challenges;
- **Update** the audience on the state of Artificial Intelligence systems as implemented in major hospital systems and outpatient clinical settings for an audience of early-career clinicians (you!);
- **Review best practices** for prompting chatbots like OpenEvidence for point-of-care evidence-based information;
- **Establish safeguards** against propagating misinformation, hallucination, decontextualized/overgeneralized data, and structural biases by AI models in clinical care.
- **Expand beyond ChatGPT**. There are better models out there for your clinical (and personal/studying) needs!
- **Apply & Demo** state-of-the-art models to various clinical scenarios.

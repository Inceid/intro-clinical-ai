Our ICW session covers how to *intelligently use* LLMs.

But not how to build them!

For those curious to learn more, these are **fast, hands-on** courses on common topics in LLM design relevant for anyone in medicine. All courses are free and hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

Highest yield courses listed first.

## LLMs  
Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human language.  

**Biomedical applications:**  
- Clinical documentation automation  
- Medical question answering  
- Literature summarization  
- Patient communication tools

Learn how to train, fine-tune, and deploy large language models with Hugging Face Transformers: https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/1  

If you can code, try the [smol course](https://huggingface.co/learn/smol-course/unit0/1) instead.

## Agents  
AI agents are systems that can autonomously plan and execute sequences of actions, often using LLMs for reasoning.  

Build multi-step reasoning tools and AI agents that can execute instructions with LangChain + Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit0/introduction  

**Biomedical applications:**  
- Automated literature review  
- Clinical workflow automation  
- Intelligent virtual assistants for clinicians or patients

## Deep RL  
Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a technique where agents learn optimal actions through trial and error in simulated environments.  

Understand reinforcement learning and train agents to learn from environments: https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/en/unit0/introduction  

**Biomedical applications:**  
- Optimizing treatment strategies  
- Personalized medicine  
- Robotic surgery and medical device control

## Computer Vision  
Computer vision enables machines to interpret and process visual information from images or videos.  

Apply AI to object detection, segmentation, and image classification: https://huggingface.co/learn/computer-vision-course/unit0/welcome/welcome  

**Biomedical applications:**  
- Automated analysis of radiology and pathology images  
- Disease detection and classification  
- Image-based diagnostics

---

## Audio Manipulation  
AI models can process and generate audio data, including speech and sounds.  

Use transformers for speech recognition, music tagging, and synthesis: https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter0/introduction  

**Biomedical applications:**  
- Voice-based digital health assistants  
- Analysis of patient speech for neurological assessment

---

## Diffusion Models  
Diffusion models are generative AI systems that create data (like images) by learning to reverse a gradual noise-adding process.

Learn how tools like Stable Diffusion generate images from noise: https://huggingface.co/learn/diffusion-course/unit0/1  

**Biomedical applications:**  
- Synthetic medical image generation for training and research  
- Data augmentation for rare diseases  
- Image enhancement and denoising in radiology

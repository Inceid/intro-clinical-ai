A **reactive** or **single-turn agent** responds to a set of input stimuli using a set of *pre-defined* rules without leveraging memory or planning.

Examples like [goblin.tools](<https://goblin.tools/>) can
- break down tasks
- create recipe ideas
- estimate time taken to complete a task.

An **autonomous agent** exhibits independence. Given a goal, it will perform a complex set of tasks within its resource/search constraints to achieve that goal.

Free, user-friendly examples include [AgentGPT](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/).

>**Note!** Considerations for AgentGPT
>	- the tool explicitly shows its work and search process.
>	- But the free model can give up occasionally during execution. This usually happens if you set a very ambitious goal or try to generate a very long output.
>	- If this happens, try rephrasing your goal to be more concise, or break it into smaller tasks.

>**Hold on!** Why can't I just use Chat!?
>Agents **break down the goal into sub-tasks**, plan steps, and execute them in sequenceâ€”**without further user input**. ChatGPT can't quite do this without extensive additional prompting.
